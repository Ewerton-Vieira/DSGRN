## Overview 

This project uses computational dynamics to produce
dynamical surveys of switching models of regulatory 
networks. The resulting data is stored into a database
which can then be queried for further research.

## Installation

### Dependencies

* Modern C++ compiler
* sqlite3
* Python3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Open MPI and mpi4py (optional)

### Installation on macOS

    # Install Modern C++
    xcode-select --install    # Then click "install" button on dialog
    # Install Homebrew <https://brew.sh>, an open source package manager
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will also want `python3`; both homebrew's python and Anaconda3 have been tested.

For Anaconda3: See <https://www.anaconda.com> for instructions. This seems to be the most fool-proof setup for most people.

Another option is to use homebrew python:

    brew install python

To use the `Signatures` tool, which uses MPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface> you also need:

    brew install openmpi
    pip install mpi4py

Finally,

    # Install DSGRN
    git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/DSGRN.git
    cd DSGRN
    ./install.sh

### Installation on Linux

On an HPC cluster it is likely modern compilers, python, and a suitable version of MPI are already installed.
However, you cannot `pip install` due to permissions issues. In this case one solution is to pass the `--user` flag:

    pip install mpi4py --user
    # Install DSGRN
    git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/DSGRN.git
    cd DSGRN
    ./install.sh --user

This would put the `Signatures` script in `~/.local/bin`, so you may consider putting that on your `PATH`.

On your own system you may use the package manager to install dependencies, e.g.

    sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev

on Ubuntu. 

### Uninstalling

    pip uninstall DSGRN

<!--
### Latest Stable Version

To get the latest tagged version from the PyPi repository:

```bash
pip install dsgrn
```

To uninstall:

```bash
pip uninstall dsgrn
```
-->

## Examples and Documentation

See `Tutorials` folder for examples.

Also see the [documentation](https://shaunharker.github.io/DSGRN/).

## Troubleshooting

### Can't get it to work with your version of python

Try Anaconda3 <https://www.anaconda.com>.

This will install into a folder named `anaconda3` and add a line in `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
#added by Anaconda3 5.0.1 installer
#export PATH="/PATH/TO/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
```

This will redirect command line python and pip. Note you may have to start a new `bash` session for the path changes to take effect (i.e. close and reopen the terminal program). This has the effect of plastering over any problems you might be having with multiple installations/permissions problems/jupyter not seeing the package/etc.

### For macOS users with permissions issues:

If the installation gives permissions issues, oftentimes the culprit is broken permissions on the subfolders of the homebrew folder `/usr/local`. 

First, see what

```
brew doctor
```

says. A common fix is:

```
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
```

If it still doesn't work after this, then you might try uninstalling and reinstalling homebrew.

To uninstall homebrew:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

Or `sudo` if it gives issues:

```
sudo ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

To install homebrew (don't use `sudo` here!):

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### For Linux users with permissions issues:

For missing dependencies, you'll need to contact your system admin.

For python modules, you can pass the `--user` flag:

    # Install DSGRN
    git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/DSGRN.git
    cd DSGRN
    ./install.sh --user


### Python/Jupyter Integration issues:

If the package installs but it is not visible in jupyter, the likely problem is that the jupyter python kernel is not the same python for which pychomp was installed. That is, you may have multiple pythons on your system.

You can try to confirm this by typing

```
which python
which pip
which jupyter
```

Possible fixes include steps such as 

1. checking/changing your environmental variable `PATH` in `~/.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`
2. uninstalling python and jupyter, then reinstalling python then jupyter
3. plastering over with anaconda3
4. googling for answers until 3AM

### You suspect you have an old install of DSGRN conflicting

In python, type

```python
import DSGRN
print(DSGRN.__name__)
```

This will tell you the path to the DSGRN the python module loader used, and you can check if it correct.
