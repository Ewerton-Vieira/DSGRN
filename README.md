# DSGRN
Dynamic Signatures of Gene Regulatory Networks

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/DSGRN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/DSGRN) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/shaunharker/DSGRN/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/shaunharker/DSGRN?branch=master)

This project uses computational dynamics to produce
dynamical surveys of switching models of gene regulatory 
networks. The resulting data is stored into a database
which can then be queried for further research.

This project is still in development!
Installation instructions will be offered soon.
