The installation proceeds in three stages.
First, install the prerequisites.
Second, build and install the DSGRN software.
Third, emplace the "logic" resources.

Step 1. Install Prerequisites

The prerequisites are:

C++11 compiler
Boost 1.58
Open MPI

For Mac OS X: 
  C++11 comes along with the standard command line tools.
  For Boost and OpenMPI I recommend using the "homebrew" installer.


Step 2. Build DSGRN

After the prerequisites are installed, cd to the main DSGRN directory and type the following:

make
make test       # optional
make install

"make install" will copy a binary "dsgrn" into /usr/local/bin
and it will copy libraries into /usr/local/lib.

In order for the software to work, certain resource files must also be
put into place into /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic

To obtain these resource files there are two options:

1. Build them yourself.

cd software/NetworkLogic
make
./NetworkLogic
## wait
mkdir /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic
cp *.dat /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic

2. Download them from somewhere and put them in place.
(Currently they are not publicly hosted.)
