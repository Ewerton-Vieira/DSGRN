# DSGRN Installation Instructions

The installation proceeds in two stages.
First, install the prerequisites.
Second, build and install the DSGRN software.

== Prerequisites

The prerequisites are:

* C++11 compiler
* Boost 1.58
* Open MPI
* https://github.com/shaunharker/cluster-delegator.git[cluster-delegator]
* sqlite3

== About the installation

DSGRN is installed by invoking the `install.sh` script in the source root. 
The location it installed is determined by the so-called installation prefix.
This can be specified as in the following example:

```
./install.sh --prefix=/opt/local
```

If the installation prefix is not specified than a default value is used.
This value is `/usr/local`. If, however, you do not have write privileges to `/usr/local`,
then the installer will check to see if you have a directory named `~/.local`. 
If you do, then that will be the installation prefix. Otherwise the installer fails.

Assuming an installation prefix of `/usr/local` the files installed are as follows:

```
  /usr/local/bin        (dsgrn)
  /usr/local/lib        (libdsgrn.a, libdsgrn.so, libdsgrn.dylib)
  /usr/local/share      (DSGRN/logic/*.dat)
```

=== Mac OS X: 

On Mac OS X, C++11 and sqlite3 come along with the standard command line tools. For Boost and OpenMPI I recommend using the "homebrew" installer. Cluster-delegator can be retrieved from the git repository.

Example installation using homebrew:

```
brew install boost
brew install openmpi
git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/cluster-delegator.git
./cluster-delegator/install.sh
git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/DSGRN.git
./DSGRN/install.sh
```

=== Linux:

Logs of successful Linux installations are available from Travis CI:

https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/DSGRN

You may find the included scripts
```
  ./.travis.yml
  ./.install/boost.sh
  ./.install/openmpi.sh
  ./.install/sqlite3.sh
```
useful.
