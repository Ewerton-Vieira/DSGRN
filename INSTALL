The installation proceeds in three stages.
First, install the prerequisites.
Second, build and install the DSGRN software.
Third, compute/acquire "logic" resources and put them

Step 1. Install Prerequisites

The prerequisites are:

C++11 compiler
Boost 1.58
Open MPI

For Mac OS X: 
  C++11 comes along with the standard command line tools.
  For Boost and OpenMPI I recommend using the "homebrew" installer.


Step 2. Build DSGRN

After the prerequisites are installed, cd to the main DSGRN directory and type the following:

./install.sh

This will attempt to install the program "dsgrn" into 

  /usr/local/bin

and libraries into 
  
  /usr/local/lib.

If this is not suitable, you can do the following instead:

./install.sh /some/other/path

which will put things in
/some/other/path/bin
/some/other/path/lib


Step 3. Build/Acquire logic resources and put them in place

In order for the software to work, certain resource files must also be
put into place into either the default location

  /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic

or else if you used an alternative installation prefix, e.g. /some/other/path 
then you must put these resource files in 

  /some/other/path/DSGRN/logic

To obtain these resource files there are two options:

A. Build them yourself.

cd software/NetworkLogic
make
./NetworkLogic
## wait
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic
cp *.dat /usr/local/share/DSGRN/logic

B. Download them from somewhere and put them in place.
(Currently they are not publicly hosted.)
