# DSGRN Installation Instructions

The installation proceeds in two stages.
First, install the prerequisites.
Second, build and install the DSGRN software.

== Step 1. Install Prerequisites ==

The prerequisites are:

* C++11 compiler
* Boost 1.58
* Open MPI
* https://github.com/shaunharker/cluster-delegator.git[cluster-delegator]
* sqlite3

=== Mac OS X: 

C++11 and sqlite3 come along with the standard command line tools. For Boost and OpenMPI I recommend using the "homebrew" installer. Cluster-delegator can be retrieved from the git repository.

Example:

```
brew install boost
brew install openmpi
git clone https://github.com/shaunharker/cluster-delegator.git
cd cluster-delegator
./install.sh
```

=== Linux:

Logs of successful Ubuntu Linux installations are available from Travis CI:

https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/DSGRN

== Step 2. Build DSGRN ==

After the prerequisites are installed, DSGRN is installed by invoking the `install.sh` script in the source root. Without arguments, this will attempt to install the program "dsgrn" into 

```
  /usr/local/bin  
  /usr/local/lib
  /usr/local/share
```

If you do not have write privileges to /usr/local, then ./install.sh
will check to see if you have a directory named 

```
  ~/.local
```

If so, it will try to install to

```
  ~/.local/bin
  ~/.local/lib
  ~/.local/share
```

If this is not available then the script will end in failure.

You can remedy the situation by either creating the directory ~/.local, or else supplying an alternative installation path, e.g. /opt/local

```
./install.sh --prefix=/opt/local
```

which will put things in

```
  /opt/local/bin
  /opt/local/lib
  /opt/local/share
```

Be sure to put the installation path bin folder on your path!
